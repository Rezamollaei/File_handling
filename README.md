This C program demonstrates file handling, input/output operations, and basic data type conversions. It reads and writes data to files (Input.txt and Output.txt), processes user input (integers, characters, and strings), and uses functions like fgetc, fputc, fgets, and fputs to manipulate file contents. The program also performs casting and mathematical operations, showcasing multiple ways to interact with files and input in C.
